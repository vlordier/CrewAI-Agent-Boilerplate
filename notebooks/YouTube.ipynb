       "[Document(page_content='Michael Krigsman: Welcome to CXOTalk. Episode\\xa0 number 837. Today we\\'re exploring the technology\\xa0\\xa0 behind AI and the implications for workforce\\xa0 transformation. Our guest is Kian Katanforoosh,\\xa0\\xa0 and he is co-creator of Stanford\\'s Deep Learning\\xa0 course and CEO of a company called Workera.\\xa0 Kian Katanforoosh: In 2017, I co-created the\\xa0 Deep Learning Class at Stanford with Andrew Ng,\\xa0\\xa0 one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.\\xa0 And together we\\'ve taught AI and deep learning\\xa0\\xa0 to over 4 million students, both on campus\\xa0 but also online through an initiative we\\xa0\\xa0 call deeplearning.ai. The goal at the time\\xa0 was to democratize access to AI education.\\xa0 And as all these students around the world were\\xa0 taking our classes and watching our videos,\\xa0\\xa0 some of them pointed out that, with the emergence\\xa0 of content, they\\'re drowning in a notion where any\\xa0\\xa0 skill can be learned in 2000s of different ways.\\xa0 But one of the gaps that they pointed out they had\\xa0\\xa0 was understanding their skills. \"What am I good\\xa0 at? What am I lacking? What benchmarks do I need?\\xa0\\xa0 Am I better than the average big tech engineer\\xa0 or the average product manager out there?\" And\\xa0\\xa0 so in 2019, as we were getting this feedback,\\xa0 we created another company called Workera,\\xa0\\xa0 which is a skills technology company that\\xa0 leverages AI to help organizations and individuals\\xa0\\xa0 verify their skills, future-proof themselves. And it turns out that when you are more self-aware\\xa0\\xa0 about your skills, you can make the right\\xa0 decisions. You may not need to do a 200-hour\\xa0\\xa0 class when you can take a ten-hour class and\\xa0 five articles that directly focus on your job.\\xa0 Michael Krigsman: When we hear terms like\\xa0 deep learning and like machine learning,\\xa0\\xa0 what are we actually referring to? Kian Katanforoosh: The way you can\\xa0\\xa0 think of AI is a large field of study\\xa0 focused on making machines capable of\\xa0\\xa0 performing certain tasks that would typically\\xa0 be performed by humans. But AI can encompass\\xa0\\xa0 anything from the most simplistic algorithms to\\xa0 the most advanced neural networks, if you will.\\xa0\\xa0 Machine learning, on the other hand, is the subset\\xa0 of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that\\xa0\\xa0 are learning. As the name suggests, they\\xa0 can perform tasks without being explicitly\\xa0\\xa0 programmed for that task. And deep learning is\\xa0 even a smaller subset of machine learning, which\\xa0\\xa0 focuses on algorithms that are broadly mimicking\\xa0 neurons as we know them in the human brain.\\xa0\\xa0 The analogy is not super accurate, but you can\\xa0 think of it as neurons that ingest information\\xa0\\xa0 and that end up learning certain things. And so if I give you an example to understand\\xa0\\xa0 the three levels, when you\\'re going to Google Maps\\xa0 and you\\'re trying to go from point A to point B,\\xa0\\xa0 AI in the background is optimizing the route\\xa0 from point A to point B. Now imagine you\\xa0\\xa0 want to add traffic in real-time and take it into\\xa0 consideration. Now your algorithm needs to adapt,\\xa0\\xa0 and the route may change on a day-to-day basis.\\xa0 And now we\\'re in the realm of machine learning.\\xa0\\xa0 If you now want to have an autonomous car that\\xa0 understands highly unstructured data, like images,\\xa0\\xa0 like video streams, we call that perception\\xa0 algorithms or computer vision. Now you\\'re talking\\xa0\\xa0 deep learning. It\\'s the family of algorithms\\xa0 that is the best suited for that type of problem.\\xa0 Michael Krigsman: Can you shed some\\xa0 light on how these technologies\\xa0\\xa0 work? Because again, we know the terminology. Kian Katanforoosh: Imagine that you are trying\\xa0\\xa0 to build a model that is meant to detect whether\\xa0 there is a cat or no cats on a given picture.\\xa0\\xa0 Well, if I ask you to go on a whiteboard and write\\xa0 the formula that is meant to detect cats, will you\\xa0\\xa0 be able to do it or not? There is no such formula.\\xa0 We don\\'t understand the mathematical formula.\\xa0 So instead of writing a formula, I am going to\\xa0 program a function that is highly complex. The\\xa0\\xa0 function is highly adaptable. It has parameters\\xa0 that can be fitted on data. And so instead of\\xa0\\xa0 writing a formula, I am going to select a\\xa0 large enough data set of cat pictures and\\xa0\\xa0 non-cat pictures. And I\\'m going to label them\\xa0 cats or non-cats. And I\\'m going to iteratively\\xa0\\xa0 give maybe a picture at a time to the model\\xa0 and let the model predict whether there\\'s a\\xa0\\xa0 cat or no cats. And if the model is right, I\\'m\\xa0 going to give it a thumbs-up and reinforce the\\xa0\\xa0 fact that the function it is fitting is\\xa0 probably correct. If the model is wrong,\\xa0\\xa0 instead, I\\'m going to ask the model to modify its\\xa0 parameters—to modify the function it is fitting.\\xa0 And it turns out that if you do that thousands\\xa0 of times, sometimes millions of times,\\xa0\\xa0 you end up having learned the function to detect\\xa0 cats, and the model can then use that function\\xa0\\xa0 in real-time on a new data set that it has\\xa0 never seen, and it will be able to detect\\xa0\\xa0 a cat. And that\\'s called the learning process. Michael Krigsman: Help folks listening to have\\xa0\\xa0 a better understanding of under the\\xa0 covers. When that cat recognition is\\xa0\\xa0 taking place, how does it actually happen? Kian Katanforoosh: One of the things to know\\xa0\\xa0 about machine learning is the differences between\\xa0 the training process, which I just described, and\\xa0\\xa0 the prediction or the inference process—that is,\\xa0 you using that cat detector for a specific purpose\\xa0\\xa0 on a use case that can be an industrial use case\\xa0 or a business use case. So once you understood the\\xa0\\xa0 training process that I described, you now have a\\xa0 model that has parameters that have been fitted on\\xa0\\xa0 a data set, and the model is ready to be used. You can now put a camera in your garden and\\xa0\\xa0 upload, if you will, that model either on cloud\\xa0 infrastructure if the camera is connected to\\xa0\\xa0 the internet, or directly by putting a file of\\xa0 parameters and an architecture on the camera.\\xa0\\xa0 And whenever a video stream or an image\\xa0 is captured by the camera, that image,\\xa0\\xa0 which is essentially a set of pixels that can\\xa0 be described in computer science with numbers,\\xa0\\xa0 is fed into the model. The model is going\\xa0 to process it. Remember the function I was\\xa0\\xa0 talking about earlier? The image is fed into\\xa0 the function. The function will compute—or we\\xa0\\xa0 calculate the function—the model will calculate\\xa0 the function we fit. In the end, you will receive\\xa0\\xa0 a probability between 0 and 1, indicating whether\\xa0 the model thinks there\\'s a cat or no cats in the\\xa0\\xa0 image. And this is called the inference process.\\xa0 The prediction process from input to output. Michael Krigsman: So what are the implications\\xa0 of this for business people in terms of the\\xa0\\xa0 applications? And how does this then relate\\xa0 to generative AI and the type of applications\\xa0\\xa0 that are suitable for AI and where problems\\xa0 arise, such as hallucinations, for example?\\xa0 Kian Katanforoosh: As a business leader,\\xa0 you\\'re probably facing many use cases,\\xa0\\xa0 and not everything will be solvable by AI. But\\xa0 the reason AI will matter is by understanding\\xa0\\xa0 how artificial intelligence works, or AI works,\\xa0 you will understand how to develop a competitive\\xa0\\xa0 advantage, maybe for your business or your\\xa0 organization. You will be better positioned\\xa0\\xa0 to determine what strategic investments to make. To go back to the example I was giving you with\\xa0\\xa0 Google Maps, the first version I was describing\\xa0 that takes us on a map from point A to point\\xa0\\xa0 B does not require meaningful data to be fed. It\\xa0 is... if you were to solve that problem, you would\\xa0\\xa0 not have to think about the data that you collect.\\xa0 However, if you\\'re building an autonomous car,\\xa0\\xa0 you will need to have tons of data about roads\\xa0 and traffic signals and pedestrians. And so\\xa0\\xa0 understanding the capabilities of AI, the learning\\xa0 process, will allow you, as a business leader,\\xa0\\xa0 to determine what type of data you need to\\xa0 collect and whether that data can translate\\xa0\\xa0 into a competitive mode for your organization. The other thing that I find helpful as a business\\xa0\\xa0 practitioner is you probably will be asked\\xa0 to maybe hire an AI team or a data team,\\xa0\\xa0 and without the knowledge of AI, you will\\xa0 struggle to determine who to hire or who\\xa0\\xa0 to put on what projects. And so understanding\\xa0 the different specialties matters. And finally,\\xa0\\xa0 we\\'re in a world where different AI\\xa0 technologies might be subject to different\\xa0\\xa0 regulatory concerns—privacy, transparency,\\xa0 explainability—and understanding those topics\\xa0\\xa0 will really help you determine what to do. Michael Krigsman: As business leaders are\\xa0\\xa0 looking at their workforce and the implications\\xa0 of AI, what are some of the key issues that\\xa0\\xa0 they really need to be thinking about today? Kian Katanforoosh: There is a metric shared\\xa0\\xa0 on a regular basis by the World Economic Forum,\\xa0 called The Half-Life of Skills. That explains\\xa0\\xa0 how long a skill might be helpful in someone\\'s\\xa0 career. 40 years ago, the half-life of skill\\xa0\\xa0 was above ten years, meaning that you do not\\xa0 need, as a worker, to refresh your skills too\\xa0\\xa0 frequently. Most recently, the World Economic\\xa0 Forum has shared that the half-life of skill is\\xa0\\xa0 around four years. In digital fields like AI, it\\'s\\xa0 probably even closer to two years. We are seeing\\xa0\\xa0 the half-life of skills compress, which means that\\xa0 we constantly need to reinvent ourselves, to learn\\xa0\\xa0 new skills if we want to innovate. And so AI has\\xa0 pushed us to become skills-based organizations.\\xa0 And when skills are moving so fast and you need\\xa0 to refresh your competencies so fast, being\\xa0\\xa0 self-aware of your strengths and your gaps becomes\\xa0 increasingly important because we don\\'t have all\\xa0\\xa0 the time in the world. We need to determine what\\xa0 classes we\\'re going to take, what subject matter\\xa0\\xa0 areas we\\'re going to focus the next ten hours\\xa0 of our learning on. And without knowing our\\xa0\\xa0 capabilities, we are not able to make the right\\xa0 decisions, which is where Workera comes in to\\xa0\\xa0 serve organizations to accelerate their learning. Michael Krigsman: The issue, then, is one of\\xa0\\xa0 having a clear understanding of the skills\\xa0 that are present inside the organization\\xa0\\xa0 and where the trajectory is going. Was\\xa0 that an accurate way of describing it?\\xa0 Kian Katanforoosh: Yes. So I would say there\\xa0 are two steps. The first one is, \"Where are we\\xa0\\xa0 at?\" Let\\'s benchmark ourselves with an adaptive\\xa0 test aligned with the business objectives of the\\xa0\\xa0 organization because every business is slightly\\xa0 different. So the type of skills you will need is\\xa0\\xa0 also slightly different. So the first question\\xa0 is, \"Where are we at?\" The second question,\\xa0\\xa0 as you measure over time, is, \"How fast are\\xa0 we moving?\" And this is a metric that we call\\xa0\\xa0 learning velocity, that we believe is a new\\xa0 competitive advantage for businesses. Making\\xa0\\xa0 sure that you have a high learning velocity\\xa0 is essentially bulletproofing yourself against\\xa0\\xa0 disruption, to make sure that whenever there is\\xa0 a new innovation, a new language model, a new\\xa0\\xa0 method that comes out in the market, you have\\xa0 a team that is able to learn it and apply it to\\xa0\\xa0 your domain and produce a meaningful innovation. Michael Krigsman: I guess one of the challenges\\xa0\\xa0 that business leaders face right now is\\xa0 understanding that trajectory because AI is moving\\xa0\\xa0 so quickly. And so how should—how can business\\xa0 leaders deal with that issue of needing to\\xa0\\xa0 assess and needing to understand where\\xa0 things are going and not knowing? Really.\\xa0 Kian Katanforoosh: As a business leader, you are\\xa0 uniquely positioned to understand the capabilities\\xa0\\xa0 you need in order to solve the projects that you\\xa0 have ahead of you, the OKRs that you\\'re trying to\\xa0\\xa0 meet, the sales that you\\'re trying to make. And\\xa0 that is what\\'s unique about business leaders.\\xa0\\xa0 Over the last ten years, business leaders have\\xa0 been asked to be doing all sorts of things that\\xa0\\xa0 they\\'re not meant to know. You know, most of\\xa0 us business leaders were promoted because we\\xa0\\xa0 had subject matter expertise in an area. We were\\xa0 not promoted, most of the time, because we were\\xa0\\xa0 a great talent manager, because we had a PhD in\\xa0 psychometrics—the ability to measure skills in\\xa0\\xa0 our team—because we were learning scientists and\\xa0 understood what the best content is out there for\\xa0\\xa0 our team. That is not why we—you\\'re promoted\\xa0 into that role. And so your job is not to go\\xa0\\xa0 and screen the internet and find what is the best\\xa0 class for employee A or employee B. Your job is,\\xa0\\xa0 \"Can I translate meaningfully my company\\'s\\xa0 capabilities and OKRs and business objectives into\\xa0\\xa0 a series of skills that I can measure my team on?\"\\xa0 That\\'s the question you should be asking yourself.\\xa0 Michael Krigsman: We have another question from\\xa0 Twitter, and this is from Lisbeth Shaw, who says\\xa0\\xa0 how should organizations upskill their workforce\\xa0 in advance before people are displaced by AI,\\xa0\\xa0 anticipating potential displacements in the future\\xa0 and hopefully trying to mitigate or prevent them?\\xa0 Kian Katanforoosh: Over the last ten years,\\xa0 upskilling was content-led. So we have platforms\\xa0\\xa0 that provide courses and podcasts and videos\\xa0 and books, and there\\'s a ton of content out\\xa0\\xa0 there. Managers will say, I have selected a course\\xa0 that is 200 hours and post that course. There is\\xa0\\xa0 a quiz that may validate someone has learned the\\xa0 video, and then after that, I\\'m going to find the\\xa0\\xa0 projects for people. What happens is engagement\\xa0 is low because users employees report that the\\xa0\\xa0 course was just not relevant to their career. It\\xa0 may have been too easy, it may have been too hard,\\xa0\\xa0 and thus they haven\\'t completed. But even\\xa0 for those who have completed, the manager\\xa0\\xa0 cannot verify their skills because the quiz was\\xa0 aligned with the content. It was just verifying\\xa0\\xa0 whether they watched the video or not. And the\\xa0 project is misaligned with the generated class\\xa0\\xa0 that they were invited to do. And so we run into\\xa0 a ton of issues from an upskilling time wasted,\\xa0\\xa0 nothing to do after the course, nothing to apply\\xa0 your skills into. What\\'s happening right now is\\xa0\\xa0 that that approach, content-led, is being flipped,\\xa0 where content is actually the last step of the\\xa0\\xa0 upskilling program, the way it\\'s done in the\\xa0 foremost thinking organizations is you start with\\xa0\\xa0 the projects. If you have projects, if you don\\'t\\xa0 have identified projects, you start with the job\\xa0\\xa0 architecture. How have you defined your job roles,\\xa0 your job families, your job levels? What are the\\xa0\\xa0 skills involved in those? Can you incorporate\\xa0 your OKRs? That is the outcome or the outcome\\xa0\\xa0 is then translated into a skill ontology granular\\xa0 set of skills that are representative of what you\\xa0\\xa0 want people to develop that skill. Ontology is\\xa0 being verified with the verification system that\\xa0\\xa0 is not meant to verify if someone has watched\\xa0 a video, it is meant to verify someone has the\\xa0\\xa0 skill on the job that you have defined in your\\xa0 ontology, and then only when you measure people\\xa0\\xa0 on that ontology, you can talk about content and\\xa0 determine that Alice needs a seven-hour class,\\xa0\\xa0 but Bob needs a 200-hour degree program. But Eve\\xa0 needs just to watch a video and read two research\\xa0\\xa0 papers. And that is what\\'s going to help us\\xa0 drive upskilling that is business-driven,\\xa0\\xa0 not content-driven. And that is the big trend\\xa0 that we\\'re seeing in the market at the moment. Michael Krigsman: Kian, you\\'ve mentioned several\\xa0 times the importance of understanding the problem\\xa0\\xa0 and understanding the data in order to\\xa0 successfully apply AI. Can you give us\\xa0\\xa0 some examples of use cases that you\\'ve\\xa0 seen where understanding the problem\\xa0\\xa0 and the data has been particularly important? Kian Katanforoosh: Use cases are going to fall\\xa0\\xa0 under one of three categories. The products and\\xa0 solutions innovation, the productivity use cases,\\xa0\\xa0 and the security and risk mitigation use cases.\\xa0 And I\\'ve seen plenty of these three categories,\\xa0\\xa0 on the products and solutions innovation. I called\\xa0 out the use case about predictive maintenance on\\xa0\\xa0 drilling. To give you another example. You know,\\xa0 I\\'ve seen medical students, medical practitioners\\xa0\\xa0 work on x-ray images in order to determine if\\xa0 a patient has pneumonia or not. Again, here,\\xa0\\xa0 the problem can be resolved to a certain extent\\xa0 with computer vision and AI. But who is going to\\xa0\\xa0 solve that problem? The medical experts, because\\xa0 they understand the metrics that will be used to\\xa0\\xa0 evaluate the model, to understand the deployment\\xa0 environment. They understand the clinical setting.\\xa0\\xa0 They can show you in the clinical room, in the\\xa0 Stanford Hospital, which machine the model is\\xa0\\xa0 going to be running on. All these things are\\xa0 uniquely requiring medical expertise. Another\\xa0\\xa0 example that would come to mind is a group of\\xa0 people building a camera that you ingest your\\xa0\\xa0 mouse and that is meant to take pictures of your\\xa0 gastrointestinal journey and then will spit out\\xa0\\xa0 certain predictions and certain pathologies that\\xa0 you may or or you may have. And those are again,\\xa0\\xa0 projects that require subject matter expertise\\xa0 and AI. There are plenty of these projects on\\xa0\\xa0 the risk and security mitigation. Companies are\\xa0 worried that they will face data privacy issues,\\xa0\\xa0 that some of the employees will leak data.\\xa0 And so what they\\'re doing is get ahead of it,\\xa0\\xa0 employees are going to use it regardless of\\xa0 whether you ban it or not. We know that already,\\xa0\\xa0 and we\\'ve seen it in multiple organizations. So\\xa0 what can you do? You can put together certain\\xa0\\xa0 skills verification, certain certifications in\\xa0 order to make sure that people are aware of the\\xa0\\xa0 risks of using artificial intelligence or not.\\xa0 So a lot of the use cases are risk mitigation,\\xa0\\xa0 and and increasing security on that front. Michael Krigsman: Here\\'s a question from\\xa0\\xa0 again from Arsalan Khan, who says I might help\\xa0 to improve a process, but perhaps we still need\\xa0\\xa0 holistic thinkers who can tell that the process\\xa0 itself is just wrong. Who is going to do this? The\\xa0\\xa0 AI, the human, the business people, the technical\\xa0 people? In other words, who\\'s got the overall view\\xa0\\xa0 that we\\'re actually headed in the right direction? Kian Katanforoosh: Absolutely. It is not the AI,\\xa0\\xa0 it is the subject matter experts. That is why\\xa0 I think subject matter expertise is going to\\xa0\\xa0 increase in importance in the coming years. You\\xa0 are working on any AI system. Who is going to\\xa0\\xa0 stamp that AI system and say it works? The\\xa0 subject matter experts, your AI deployments\\xa0\\xa0 will be as good as the expertise that you have in\\xa0 the domain. A good company working on a great AI\\xa0\\xa0 tool will have the expertise to say, this is how\\xa0 AI will be incorporated into the process. This is\\xa0\\xa0 how the process needs to change. This is how we\\xa0 need to think about the business outcome. And so\\xa0\\xa0 I don\\'t think that subject matter expertise is\\xa0 going anywhere. If anything, I believe we will\\xa0\\xa0 need more PhDs. We will need more domain experts.\\xa0 We will need people who know what they\\'re doing in\\xa0\\xa0 the subject matter that they\\'re focused on. Michael Krigsman: Which raises another very\\xa0\\xa0 interesting and important point, which is\\xa0 what should business professionals do to\\xa0\\xa0 retain their relevance as the great source\\xa0 of knowledge in the sky increases, namely\\xa0\\xa0 the large language models that know everything. Kian Katanforoosh: There is tons of innovation\\xa0\\xa0 ahead of us that we have not seen come to the\\xa0 world yet. It is just going to accelerate. If\\xa0\\xa0 you can keep up with the pace, you will have\\xa0 a great career. You will contribute to the\\xa0\\xa0 next generation of technologies that will be\\xa0 produced. You will solve certain use cases,\\xa0\\xa0 but it is very important to have that mindset of\\xa0 lifelong learning. I think it\\'s more important\\xa0\\xa0 than ever. The other thing is the self-awareness.\\xa0 As more and more information comes to our world,\\xa0\\xa0 we have to face critical decisions on how to spend\\xa0 our time. The best of us, the most self-aware,\\xa0\\xa0 are going to be the ones who are going to spend\\xa0 their time on what matters the most, what matters\\xa0\\xa0 to their company, what matters to their career,\\xa0 what matters to their project. And so make\\xa0\\xa0 sure that you have created the right learning\\xa0 infrastructure around yourself to be self-aware.\\xa0\\xa0 And that may come from different people or\\xa0 systems. Maybe you have a mentor or a coach\\xa0\\xa0 that keeps you aware and tells you when you\\'re\\xa0 doing something wrong or when you have a gap.\\xa0\\xa0 Maybe you\\'re using an assessment tool like we\\'re\\xa0 out to take tests on a regular basis. I do that,\\xa0\\xa0 and I took a test this weekend. I take it every\\xa0 week. And it helps me keep myself self-aware as\\xa0\\xa0 much as possible. And, so that\\'s, that\\'s the point\\xa0 I\\'m making self- awareness and learning velocity,\\xa0\\xa0 learning how to learn. These are going\\xa0 to be your your career defense ability\\xa0\\xa0 and your competitive advantage. Michael Krigsman: Self-awareness\\xa0\\xa0 and learning defense ability. Learning\\xa0 how to learn. These seem not so easy\\xa0\\xa0 skills to diffuse through an organization. Kian Katanforoosh: It is a challenge and I\\'ll\\xa0\\xa0 give you one thing that I\\'ve observed. The leaders\\xa0 we work with are great leaders. But generally,\\xa0\\xa0 leaders would fall under two categories when\\xa0 it comes to upskilling. I have seen leaders,\\xa0\\xa0 business leaders pretend that they know AI.\\xa0 The problem when you pretend and you don\\'t have\\xa0\\xa0 self-awareness is the workforce tends to mimic\\xa0 the leader. So when someone pretends, everybody\\xa0\\xa0 underneath is pretending, and that is when you\\xa0 end up with a workforce of dangerous amateurs\\xa0\\xa0 that will take you on a journey to prototype AI.\\xa0 But when it\\'s time to productize AI, you will fall\\xa0\\xa0 short. On the other hand, you have leaders that\\xa0 are approaching upskilling with humility. The\\xa0\\xa0 leaders take the work their own assessments and\\xa0 they tell their team, listen, I\\'m not yet at the\\xa0\\xa0 target score that I set for myself, but I\\'m not\\xa0 too far and I\\'m going to work on it and we\\'re\\xa0\\xa0 all in this together. The consequence of that\\xa0 is the workforce will mimic that behavior. The\\xa0\\xa0 workforce will approach upskilling with humility.\\xa0 They will test themselves. They will take action\\xa0\\xa0 on their gaps and they will try to reach their\\xa0 target score the same way their leader is trying\\xa0\\xa0 to reach their target scores. And so I invite\\xa0 business practitioners to take the approach of\\xa0\\xa0 humility rather than the approach of pretension. Michael Krigsman: Any final thoughts on the time\\xa0\\xa0 frame for disruption that\\'s likely to\\xa0 happen when it comes to workforces,\\xa0\\xa0 and just final advice on what businesses\\xa0 can do. And I\\'ll also say to the audience,\\xa0\\xa0 now is your last chance to get final questions in. Kian Katanforoosh: We\\'re very focused on AI and\\xa0\\xa0 there is an AI hype cycle. And it\\xa0 is fine. As a business practitioner,\\xa0\\xa0 don\\'t shy away from learning. I just embrace\\xa0 the hype. The hype will die out. But you would\\xa0\\xa0 have learned a ton of things while the hype\\xa0 was going. So embrace the hype. However,\\xa0\\xa0 beware. That\\'s us, we\\'re looking at AI. I believe\\xa0 the real frontier that is ahead of us is skills-\\xa0\\xa0 based organization—it is a skills-based workforce.\\xa0 Because what\\'s happening with AI is our world is\\xa0\\xa0 accelerating. Technologies are coming out more\\xa0 frequently than ever. A few weeks ago, four major\\xa0\\xa0 language models were launched in the same day from\\xa0 OpenAI and multiple competitors at the same time.\\xa0\\xa0 Think about how fast that is. So the signal is\\xa0 the future moves fast. Learning velocity will be\\xa0\\xa0 the new competitive advantage, and organizations\\xa0 are going to understand their skills, take actions\\xa0\\xa0 based on their skills, and become skills-based\\xa0 organizations— or those who will be bullied, proof\\xa0\\xa0 to any hype that will come in the future and will\\xa0 continue to develop themselves. And so that is my\\xa0\\xa0 message to conclude on this question. Michael Krigsman: And with that,\\xa0\\xa0 we are out of time. A huge thank you to Kian\\xa0 Katanforoosh. Thank you so much, Kian, for being\\xa0\\xa0 with us and sharing your expertise today. Kian Katanforoosh: Thank you, Michael,\\xa0\\xa0 for having me. It was super fun.

      "Michael Krigsman: Welcome to CXOTalk. Episode number 837. Today we're exploring the technology behind AI and the implications for workforce transformation. Our guest is Kian Katanforoosh, and he is co-creator of Stanford's Deep Learning course and CEO of a company called Workera. Kian Katanforoosh: In 2017, I co-created the Deep Learning Class at Stanford with Andrew Ng, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence. And together we've taught AI and deep learning to over 4 million students, both on campus but also online through an initiative we call deeplearning.ai. The goal at the time was to democratize access to AI education. And as all these students around the world were taking our classes and watching our videos, some of them pointed out that, with the emergence of content, they're drowning in a notion where any skill can be learned in 2000s of different ways. But one of the gaps that they pointed out they had was understanding their skills. \"What am I good at? What am I lacking? What benchmarks do I need? Am I better than the average big tech engineer or the average product manager out there?\" And so in 2019, as we were getting this feedback, we created another company called Workera, which is a skills technology company that leverages AI to help organizations and individuals verify their skills, future-proof themselves. And it turns out that when you are more self-aware about your skills, you can make the right decisions. You may not need to do a 200-hour class when you can take a ten-hour class and five articles that directly focus on your job. Michael Krigsman: When we hear terms like deep learning and like machine learning, what are we actually referring to? Kian Katanforoosh: The way you can think of AI is a large field of study focused on making machines capable of performing certain tasks that would typically be performed by humans. But AI can encompass anything from the most simplistic algorithms to the most advanced neural networks, if you will.\n",

      "Self-awareness and learning defense ability. Learning how to learn. These seem not so easy skills to diffuse through an organization.

But when it's time to productize AI, you will fall short. On the other hand, you have leaders that are approaching upskilling with humility. The leaders take the work their own assessments and they tell their team, listen, I'm not yet at the target score that I set for myself, but I'm not too far and I'm going to work on it and we're all in this together.

      "calculate the function we fit. In the end, you will receive a probability between 0 and 1, indicating whether the model thinks there's a cat or no cats in the image. And this is called the inference process. The prediction process from input to output. Michael Krigsman: So what are the implications of this for business people in terms of the applications? And how does this then relate to generative AI and the type of applications that are suitable for AI and where problems arise, such as hallucinations, for example? Kian Katanforoosh: As a business leader, you're probably facing many use cases, and not everything will be solvable by AI. But the reason AI will matter is by understanding how artificial intelligence works, or AI works, you will understand how to develop a competitive advantage, maybe for your business or your organization. You will be better positioned to determine what strategic investments to make. To go back to the example I was giving you with Google Maps, the first version I was describing that takes us on a map from point A to point B does not require meaningful data to be fed. It is. if you were to solve that problem, you would not have to think about the data that you collect. However, if you're building an autonomous car, you will need to have tons of data about roads and traffic signals and pedestrians. And so understanding the capabilities of AI, the learning process, will allow you, as a business leader, to determine what type of data you need to collect and whether that data can translate into a competitive mode for your organization. The other thing that I find helpful as a business practitioner is you probably will be asked to maybe hire an AI team or a data team, and without the knowledge of AI, you will struggle to determine who to hire or who to put on what projects. And so understanding the different specialties matters. And finally, we're in a world where different AI technologies might be subject to different regulatory\n",

      "the hype. However, beware. That's us, we're looking at AI. I believe the real frontier that is ahead of us is skills- based organization—it is a skills-based workforce. Because what's happening with AI is our world is accelerating. Technologies are coming out more frequently than ever. A few weeks ago, four major language models were launched in the same day from OpenAI and multiple competitors at the same time. Think about how fast that is. So the signal is the future moves fast. Learning velocity will be the new competitive advantage, and organizations are going to understand their skills, take actions based on their skills, and become skills-based organizations— or those who will be bullied, proof to any hype that will come in the future and will continue to develop themselves. And so that is my message to conclude on this question. Michael Krigsman: And with that, we are out of time. A huge thank you to Kian Katanforoosh. Thank you so much, Kian, for being with us and sharing your expertise today. Kian Katanforoosh: Thank you, Michael, for having me. It was super fun. Michael Krigsman: And thank you to everybody who watched and especially to those folks who asked such great questions. You guys are an amazing audience. Before you go, subscribe to our newsletter and subscribe to our YouTube channel. We do have incredible shows coming up. I always say that, you know, and it's always true. We have great guests.

      "concerns—privacy, transparency, explainability—and understanding those topics will really help you determine what to do. Michael Krigsman: As business leaders are looking at their workforce and the implications of AI, what are some of the key issues that they really need to be thinking about today? Kian Katanforoosh: There is a metric shared on a regular basis by the World Economic Forum, called The Half-Life of Skills. That explains how long a skill might be helpful in someone's career. 40 years ago, the half-life of skill was above ten years, meaning that you do not need, as a worker, to refresh your skills too frequently. Most recently, the World Economic Forum has shared that the half-life of skill is around four years. In digital fields like AI, it's probably even closer to two years. We are seeing the half-life of skills compress, which means that we constantly need to reinvent ourselves, to learn new skills if we want to innovate. And so AI has pushed us to become skills-based organizations. And when skills are moving so fast and you need to refresh your competencies so fast, being self-aware of your strengths and your gaps becomes increasingly important because we don't have all the time in the world. We need to determine what classes we're going to take, what subject matter areas we're going to focus the next ten hours of our learning on. And without knowing our capabilities, we are not able to make the right decisions, which is where Workera comes in to serve organizations to accelerate their learning. Michael Krigsman: The issue, then, is one of having a clear understanding of the skills that are present inside the organization and where the trajectory is going. Was that an accurate way of describing it? Kian Katanforoosh: Yes. So I would say there are two steps. The first one is, \"Where are we at?\" Let's benchmark ourselves with an adaptive test aligned with the business objectives of the organization because every business is slightly different. So the\n",
